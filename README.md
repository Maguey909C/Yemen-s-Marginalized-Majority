# Yemen's Marginalized Majority 

## Introduction
Among academics that conduct surveys research in the Middle East few do so in the Arabian Peninsula, even fewer attempt to do it quantitatively, and virtually none do it in the domain of public perception of the United States.  There are many reasons for this such as the difficulty of gaining permission from the Yemeni government to conduct political surveys, such research tends to unearth facts, trends, or other information the government purposely sought to obscure.  Additionally, there are many security risks associated with asking questions to be on politically sensitive topics, especially in regions that may outright oppose those supporting the research.  Then there are linguistic challenges associated with speaking the correct dialect so people can understand the questions, geographic challenges of surveying a sample of the population in regions, which may be difficult to access, educational challenges when a portion of the sample is illiterate, among many other challenges. For these reasons and others, quantitatively analyzing the Middle East through traditional survey methods is extremely problematic.

## Problem:
Yemen highlights many if not all the challenges that arise when attempting to conduct academic research in the Middle Eastern.  Of the research that exists on Yemen, it usually involves terrorism, some security or military issue, anthropological or ethnographic study of culture, history analysis, but rarely if ever is any quantitative research done, especially in the realm of public opinion surveys.  This combined with the country’s sporadic national census, and debatably only one legitimate polling agency in the country, Yemen Polling Center (YPC), makes it difficult to know attitudes of people throughout the country, unless they are publically manifested through a protest or conflict.  Social media, email, and in general the Internet has given Yemen’s marginalized majority a much stronger voice; however, many in the country do not have access to electricity, a computer, or even know how to use one.  

Another reason for conducting a national survey would be the potential impact it may have on Yemeni-United States relations.  Given the level of misunderstanding and disinformation in the public sphere, hearing the opinions of people on the ground would prove valuable for the average U.S. citizen as well as for policy makers in the United States government.  Not only would such information likely dispel many stereotypes of the region, it might even prevent the advent of war, or at least cause those who wield such power to reconsider the repercussions of such actions.  Again, in an area with limited information, it is this researchers belief that more data will do more good than harm

## Purpose
The idea of administering a public perception survey among locals in Yemen about the United States stemmed from many factors.  The first reason as aforementioned, Yemen is rarely surveyed by academic researchers, NGO’s, and major public opinion outlets such as PEW or Gallup.  To the best of my knowledge, Yemen Polling Center, the only reputable public polling agency in the country, has not conducted a public opinion survey Yemen perceptions of the United States on a national scale.  Given that their information is not public, but often contractual for specific companies, NGO’s, or other agencies, it would be difficult to obtain since it is proprietary and most often performed on a case by case basis. 

## Methodology
The methodology behind this survey is based on a survey technique called a stratified sample size.  A stratified sample size takes proportions of a given population demographics, such as gender, age, level of education, region, etc., and then applies these proportions to the specific number surveyed people, i.e. the sample size.  A random stratified sample allows the surveyor to claim not only that a given sample reflects that of a larger population, but it also avoids surveying random people within a certain gender, region, age, educational background, etc.  In this way, a stratified sample is designed to be statistically representative of a much larger population, as is in this particular case Yemen.  However, a stratified sample still involves some degree of bias in that people who willingly take a survey might be more biased in some regard to participate than those who abstain.  This is one of the many assumptions made when surveying a sample of the population, and the attempts to mitigate biases were taken by the Yemeni surveyors. 

This stratified sample drew on data from 2012 from the Central Statistical Organization within the larger Yemen’s Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation.   The stratified sample was determined by distributing Yemen’s national population in terms of age, education, gender, geographic region, and location.  Within each broader category existed subcategories in order to accurately determine the number of Yemenis to be surveyed.  

1. Age contained five categories: 15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-59, and greater than 60; 

2. Education contained five categories: university or above, secondary school, elementary school, capable of reading and writing, illiterate; 

3. Gender contained two categories: male and female; 

4. Region incorporated six categories: Azal, Tihama, Janid, Aden, Hadramout, Sept: 

5. Location incorporated two categories: urban and rural. 

The stratified sample following the survey's administration resulted in 783 respondents from 5 of the six regions. 

The survey comprised thirty-four questions  developed in collaboration with Yemeni political scientist Dr. Sami Siari over the course of six months.  The survey questions primarily were opinion based although there exist a few “yes and no” questions, fact based questions, and ranking questions.  The survey is available to download in this repository in English and Arabic.

The survey is designed to begin with less controversial questions, slowly building in intensity by asking participants to answer more sensitive, and finally receding to less sensitive types.  The purpose of this design was to avoid intimidating participants early in the survey from questions that they otherwise might have answered.  Indeed, surveying Yemenis in remote regions unaccustomed or unfamiliar with the idea of a survey, especially one about their perception of the United States, proved extremely challenging.  In Yemen, surveying about the United States is enormously problematic in that the general population struggles to understand and/or believe such surveys will be used solely for academic purposes.  Understandably many locals question the origins and intentions of the sponsors, while others simply outright refuse to participate fearing possible repercussions to them or their families.  As a result, the idea of an American surveying Yemenis about their opinions regarding drones, al-Qaeda, or the U.S. military creates a number of issues that could compromise the integrity of the results.  For this reason among many others, a team of Yemenis was hired to administer the surveys to locals. 

## Analysis:
See the code on the following page, but a combination of statistical inference and unsupervised learning techniques were used to extract novel insights from Yemeni society.

For a more thorough analysis see my book Yemen's Marginalized Majority, currently being reviewed by an editor.

## Results 
The results of this survey sheds light on a region of the Middle East that has been obscure to U.S. policymakers for years.  The findings challenge many academic assumptions held about the region while confirming others. From October 2014 to December of 2014, the team was able to collect 783 surveys from five of the six federalist regions: Azal, Hadramout, Janid Aden, and the Tihama.   This was an extraordinary success given that the country underwent a coup d’état during the survey collection process.  Coding the results proved equally difficult since many of the surveyors feared continuing their work on the project following their returned to politically chaotic Sana’a.  Only one third of the survey results were coded in December of 2014, while the other 2/3 would remain hidden until December of 2016 when those remaining in the country finished coding the results.   Since the outbreak some of the surveyors passed away, not as a result of engaging with the research, but due to the ensuing violence that overtook the country.  It is due to their sacrifice, willingness, and courage that I can humbly present these results to you today.  Their desire to shed light on their country’s people was more than academic research.  They hoped to help project the voice of many marginalized people to the larger world, and in turn believed it would bring a greater understanding to the region, and perhaps some peace. 

A sampling of novel findings based on this research are that a majority of Yemenis:

1. Agreed there were many unreported or unknown political events in Yemen
2. Saw their fellow citizens as a democratic people
3. Had not traveled outside of Yemen
4. Confirmed they would travel to the U.S. if they would not have any Visa or security problems
5. Wanted economic and political stability even if it came from a democratic regime
6. Held The U.S. government either entirely or partially responsible for creating al-Qaeda 
7. To name a few

But equally intriguing was what Yemenis were divided about such as:
1. If the U.S. government interests in Yemen represented the desires of U.S. citizens
2. Where they chose to obtain their news
3. The accuracy of Yemeni news reported by Yemeni news agencies 
4. Whether U.S. soldiers, U.S. drones, or U.S. spies troubled them the most 
5. Whether aid or the country giving aid was the most important 

In the book, these quantitative results are combined into a larger narrative of history, enthnography, and political science to weave a more comprehensive understanding of Yemeni Public Perceptions of the U.S. 

## Next Steps:
There are so many directions this study could pursue in the ensuing years.  A longitudinal study using these same questions as U.S. foreign policy in the region shifted would be worth analyzing.  Comparing these results with other future surveys in Yemen or pairing with Yemen Polling Center to conduct similar surveys would be another direction worth exploring.  Hopefully this research marks the first step towards returning the voice of Yemen's Marginalized Majority to the people who represent the country.
